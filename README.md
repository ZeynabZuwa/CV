# cv

#### Introduction
Hello everybody! :smile: \
My name is Zeynab and I'm a software developer student at NBI/Handelsakademin. \
This is my first year coding ever and I've have learned alot.\
I'm not going to lie, it's been tough learning everything from scratch but it has \
also been alot of fun when you see that you've actually accomplished to finish a program \
and that it is doing what you've imagined in the first place. \
\
This is my first time woriking with html,css and javascript using react and I made a CV as \
school project so I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do! :hugs:

#### Prerequisities
If you want to clone this repository you will need to have 2 things installed on your computer first:
* Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
* Node.js

After that you are ready to clone it down on your local computer.\
\
But I have also manage to delpoy the project using [GitHub Pages]( https://zeynabzuwa.github.io/cv/) so you can access it \
by just clicking on the GitHub Pages link, and you need to have internet on your device to do that :hand_over_mouth:. \
The website is responsive so it works great using your computer but also smaller devices such as iPads and smartphones.
 
Thank you for taking your time and please have a look out on mi GitHub for more exiting projects to come! :grin:
